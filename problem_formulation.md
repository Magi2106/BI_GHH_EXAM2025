#  SmartBike: Predictive Analytics for Bike Sharing Demand

##  Project Annotation

Urban bike-sharing systems often struggle with unpredictable demand, leading to either shortages of bikes or oversupply at stations. This project addresses the challenge of forecasting hourly or daily bike rental demand based on historical data and environmental factors. Using business intelligence tools and AI models, we aim to deliver an interactive dashboard and predictive solution. The outcome will help transportation planners and rental companies optimize operations, benefiting commuters and reducing inefficiencies.

##  Problem Statement

**Context:**  
With increased focus on sustainable transport, bike-sharing programs have become integral to urban mobility. However, effective management requires accurate demand forecasting, which remains a challenge due to variable factors such as weather and seasonality.

**Purpose:**  
To use data analytics and machine learning to predict bike rental demand, enabling proactive planning and improved user experience.

**Research Questions:**
1. What temporal and environmental patterns influence bike rental usage?
2. Can we accurately forecast hourly/daily demand using predictive models?
3. Which features contribute most to demand variability?

**Hypotheses:**
- H1: Weather significantly impacts bike rental demand.
- H2: Time features (hour, weekday, season) exhibit cyclical demand patterns.
- H3: Machine learning can forecast demand with acceptable accuracy.
